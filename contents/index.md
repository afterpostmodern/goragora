## BIOGRAPHY
Gora Gora Orkestar brings the sounds of the Balkans to the Rockies with high energy performances. Formed in the fall of 2009, this 10 piece brass band is dedicated to making the audience dance with its infectious rhythm and own brand of feel-good music. The sound is an eclectic mix, blending Old World melodies of Eastern European folk, with the back beat of American funk and the sultry sway of South American tango.

This happy caravan of musicians is comprised of seasoned veterans in the performance, education, and composition of music. The “Infinite Swag” EP was released in 2011 featuring five of Gora Gora Orkestar’s most recognizable tunes with a follow-up record slated for release in 2014.

Gora Gora Orkestar maintains a busy performance schedule which includes local and national music festivals along with headlining shows at a wide variety of venues. Community outreach is also a big part of the Gora Gora Orkestar mission as they have visited many public schools, performed for local 5k marathons and continue to participate in fund-raising for local businesses.
